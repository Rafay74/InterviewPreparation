public class strrings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 17;
        System.out.print(isOdd(n));
    }

    static boolean isOdd(int n ) {
       return  (n & 1) == 1; //true
    }
}

Explanation: 
basically machines store values in binary format so 17 will be stored like this = 10001
in binary format u can determined whether the number is Even and Odd by last digit , if its 1 = odd , 0 = even.
to get the last digit from this number we can do And between number and 1 , and get the last digit.

  10001
  00001
---------
  00001
---------
as its 1 , then it will return true.
